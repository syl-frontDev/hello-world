Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.

This has been a really really stressful day, as it took me almost 32 hours to just create my remote repository and push to Github. I know that's shitty but the silver lining is in that 32 hours, i learnt how to move between directories using the terminal, how to find a path in the terminal, how to delete a file and directory, and most importantly, the stages of git and why it is useful, all because i could not push a local repo in 2 minutes like everone else. 

Now getting the hang of this repository work
